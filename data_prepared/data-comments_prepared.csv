I, *personally*, would prefer something more on the line of a YAML document. However, for somebody not familiar with it, or not technically shavy, this could pose an additional challenge, and the proposed format looks simpler.

Hopefully one can just use them as other items in the playlist.","I think this notation does not distinguish very clearly between object type (e.g. Video) and object name (the reference we use when creating the module structure). As the command resembles natural language, this is very important, because I cannot say ""There is a Chapter with URL ..."" when I am actually defining a video. Also the way we define a video and an interaction use a different formulation.

If we want to make it look natural language, it needs to have some level of fuzzyness to recognize variants of  a specification, e.g. ""We have a Video with URL..."". This could introduce ambiguity and unexpected results. If such a language required to be exact (no variation in the formulation), then it would make it much more difficult to remember, compared to a ""normal"" scripting language.","This notation is not complicated or bad in itself, but we have again not a clear distinction between an object type and an object name.

","would these be text blocks / templates or would you need to type the whole thing out each time?

Using text-based input is definitely easier (=more effective) and quicker (=more efficient) than trying to program/code something, as I'd always need an additional IT person to help me do this.
They'd all need a bit of training to use but I think the key-value notation is as easy to learn as the natural-language and feels a LOT more efficient. 
FYI, I used the video function on LearningApps.org and that was pretty intuitive for cutting and inserting questions/titles (but not answer options) into a YouTube video.

","If you implement this kind of a notation, the users would first have to learn the syntax of the notation. In this example, the syntax is (in my opinion) more complex to learn than in the previous two notation proposals. To me, this looks very inconvenient. I would rather prefer any of the previous two notations that you presented than this one.

It will be difficult for the novice users to learn the vocabulary of this notation. For example: ""Chapter 1 starts at timestamp"". Why not ""Chapter 1 begins at timestamp""? I can imagine the more commands you implement, the more difficult will it be for the users to memorize all the vocabulary which is defined in this notation.

I think that I would need the support of a technical person*** to be able to use this notation. -> in the beginning probably, unless there is some tutorial or a well-written documentation on how to use this notation. But that is the case with most of new notations. One cannot just know it if you never learned it before.

I would imagine that most people would learn to use this notation very quickly. -> I am not that confident that most people would learn this quickly because in my experience, people are sometimes ""scared"" of notations and prefer visual editors where you can click around.","""A text-based approach could be more efficient* in order to create a video-based learning module"" -> more efficient than a graphical editor? I think not, for most of the users. It is more convenient to click and add an element than define what you want to do via text. 

Effectiveness -> in general, I would say that using notation to add interactive elements and sections to your video might give you more flexibility in designing the learning materials. In this sense, it is effective because it helps you reach your desired or intended goal. However, if effectiveness only refers to ""By formulating text you could complete the task of setting a title."" and ""By formulating text you could complete the task of creating a chapter at a timestamp with a defined title."", then a graphical editor could accomplish the same goal with less cognitive load on the user. Click, write the title, done.

Using a textual notation as a first step -> I can imagine that some would watch their video, immediately use GUI to generate titles (structure), and then use the textual notation to provide more details that are otherwise difficult or tiresome to accomplish in a GUI.

""Using a textual notation in combination with a graphical user interface (GUI)"" -> yes, absolutely. I only saw this question after I had already commented on the previous questions above. I believe this approach (a combination of both, where textual notation is meant to give more flexibility and convenience to work on the details) is the most user-friendly approach.

"34",34,54,32789223,"Well it looks like a programming language. In my opinion, many teachers not familiar with IT and programming languages will be discuraged by this notation.
I judge myself as being trained in reading and understanding several programming languages. For me it heavily depends on how many kewords exist and how complex this notation is in the end. If possible, use only a few basic keywords. When thinking about Moodle questionnaires and all the features implemented just for questionnaires or exams, the keywords and settings could get VERY complex.

I also think that a more structured approach would be much better. Use Linebreaks to make the notation look less like a programming language:
e.g.:
instead of

'interaction act1 -title ""What is an Information System"" -type multiple Choice -question ""Question Text?"" -answers  ((""Answer 1"", false) (""Answer 2"", correct))'

use

'interaction act1

      -answer: ""Answer 1"" = false

In this notation it is unclear to me:
- what the command <chapters> exactly does. Is its purpose a jump point in the video or a ""chapter"" for an outline?
Why creating a chapter in a learning video at all? The concentration span of student is usually only 5 to 10 minutes. Hence, videos longer than 5-10 minutes should be split into smaller Videos and Chapters get obsolete. I dont know how learning of students is changed, if they are provided chapters in a longer video. They might skip important parts.
- what is the purpose of the command <module>? I have no clue at all.","Ahh, in this version the idea of the command <module> gets clearer. It provides the timeline for the interactions and the video.

If this is a storyboard, I would use a different hiererchy to describe a lerarning journey or, more correct, a learning path. For this purpose, I would introduce ""scenes"".
A chapter may consist of multiple ""scenes"", where each ""scene"" consist of a video or a questionnaire or whatever.
I think, if you would use a more hierarchical approach, the story board would be much easier to read.","I think the notation might get cumbersome to some extent, as reusing keywords may lead to errors. e.g. the title of interaction 1 and the title of the module.

Also in this notation I do not get the purpose of the <module> keyword.","As I already wrote earlier:
Use a hierarchical structure (and some kind of object oriented approach - i.e. group elements according to the element, they are placed in).
Use ""scenes"", as they directly relate to story boards and would make a lot of sense for structuring the content.
Chapter (Learning path level) > ""Scene"" (Content level) > Objects (Video etc.) > Settings for objects"
"35",35,55,1776216516,"see comments from before as this approach has the same problems I can imagine as the previous one. If I were to be going down this approach, I'd be looking to do something like 'live coding' does for music performance so at least I can see the effect of code constructs has on the eventual video output. Essentially, having a live view mode that interprets the text as I type.

from before: Video is a visual medium, so the text based doesn't have any anchors. For example, how am I going to know which time code relates to what? What are the transitions going to look like, what is the sequencing of cause and effect patterns. The example is very simplistic in terms of how the text relates to the temporal aspects of the video communication.

The Live Editor Task interface abstracts away the need to type a lot of the notation, while generating and presenting the notation if a user is interested!

It is easy to makes mistakes while specifying ""options"" (""answers"") in nested parenthesis, and you'd need a good parser to provide meaningful error messages. I also wonder if the flag-based approach (for example, ""-title"") would be easy to grasp for non-technical people.

The module definition does not need the chapters to be input, so I guess they're implicitly considered chapters of the video. What if there are multiple videos? It would be good to make it explicit.

I'm guessing the textPage type will accept a body of text (if not, I'd call it something else), and it's not going to be very elegant to present it in this notation, especially with multiple paragraphs and line spacing.

What I like about the notation is that it is self-explanatory, so if I were to come back to it later, it's easy to understand and add to.
